### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Evon, a web developer based in London.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently wrapping up an e-commerce React (Redux RTK) app for a Vancouver artist and SEEKING FULL-TIME WORK (no sponsorship required).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- ðŸ’¬Ask me about: Redux/RTK, How to teach/learn, Ecological Economics ðŸ¤”
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: evon.scott@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: HIRE ME.

#### How do I stand out from the pack? What makes me âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨:

- I made this. It is more than most new devs could manage, and has the stamp of approval of my mentor, a senior engineer who works with React every day. Ask me about any line of it. Not a copy-pasta.

- A background in Sustainability, Education. I care a lot about learning, sharing my knowledge with others, and the impact of the things I/we do.

- Social science. Being methodical about understanding people (users, co-workers), their needs, the organisations they belong to, and how it all fits together (the big picture). I did the all the research for and co-wrote this.

- Proven track record of delivering on complex projects in a real collaborative professional environment (as environmental social scientist).

- Excellent written and verbal communication, with all types of people and organizations, in multiple languages (Japanese, Spanish, French, and of course English).

- Adaptable, highly motivated, and a self-starter. I learned everything I know about coding/development in 6 months of self-teaching. Imagine how much more I can learn and do for your organization in 3, 6, 12 months or more?
