### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Evon, a web developer based in London. 

I currently design and build clean, responsive web apps using a variety of tech, but particularly enjoy React Redux / Javascript / Typescript / Styled Components. I also mess around with Astro, and a fully typesafe stack: e.g. [T3](https://create.t3.gg/)

**Open to full-time or freelance opportunities**

### Featured Work

A complex e-commerce / portforlio app using React Redux Toolkit (RTK), Stripe, and Firebase Firestore & Auth.

#### How do I stand out? What makes me âœ¨ different âœ¨:



- Background in sustainability and education. I care about learning, sharing my knowledge with others, and the impact of my work.

- Social science. Being methodical, analytical, delivering complex projects, collaborating on teams. See my research in [PLOS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0219607) and at [Forest Research](https://cdn.forestresearch.gov.uk/2021/01/pput._focus_group_findings._final._aa.pdf).

- Adaptable, highly motivated, disciplined, and a self-starter. I learned everything I know about coding/development in 9 months of self-teaching.

- Excellent written and verbal communication, to all types of organisations and audiences - (I also speak Japanese, Spanish, French).
