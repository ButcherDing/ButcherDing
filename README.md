### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Evon, a web developer based in London. 

I currently design and build slick, responsive web apps using React Redux / Javascript / Typescript / Styled Components.

SEEKING FULL-TIME WORK (no sponsorship required).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently wrapping up an e-commerce React (Redux RTK) app for a Vancouver artist.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Redux/RTK, Teaching, Ecological Economics ðŸ¤”
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: evon.scott@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: HIRE ME.

Too subtle?

#### How do I stand out from other new devs? What makes me âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨:

- My portfolio, in particular [this app](https://ines-chuaqui-preview.netlify.app/) - ([repo here](https://github.com/ButcherDing/ines-chuaqui)).

- A background in sustainability and education. I care a lot about learning, sharing my knowledge with others, and the impact of the things I do.

- Social science. Being methodical about understanding people (incl. users, co-workers), their needs, the organisations/groups they belong to, and how it all fits together. For example I conducted the research for and co-wrote [this paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0219607).

- Proven track record of delivering on complex collaborative projects (as environmental social scientist).

- Excellent written and verbal communication, with all types of people and organizations, in multiple languages (Japanese, Spanish, French... and English).

- Adaptable, highly motivated, and a self-starter. I learned everything I know about coding/development in 7 months of self-teaching. Imagine how much more I can learn and do for your organization in 3, 6, 12 months or more?
