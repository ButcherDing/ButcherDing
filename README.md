### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Evon, a frontend-heavy web developer based in London. Currently I work for Byway, where I make delightful ways for people to create and book flight-free trips around Europe.

I design and build clean, responsive Web apps using React and a variety of tech. By day I enjoy using Typescript-based Next, but have also dabbled with various component libraries, frameworks like Astro, and CMS solutions like Strapi.

### Featured Work
(https://ines-chuaqui-preview.netlify.app/)
A complex e-commerce / portforlio app using React Redux Toolkit (RTK), Stripe, and Firebase Firestore & Auth.

#### What makes me âœ¨differentâœ¨:

- Background in sustainability and education. I care about learning, sharing my knowledge with others, and the impact of my work.

- Social science. Being methodical, analytical, solving problems, delivering complex projects, collaborating on teams. See my work in [PLOS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0219607) and [Forest Research](https://cdn.forestresearch.gov.uk/2021/01/pput._focus_group_findings._final._aa.pdf).

- Adaptable, highly motivated, disciplined, and a self-starter. I am self-taught.

- Excellent written and verbal communication, to all types of organisations and audiences - (I also speak Japanese, Spanish, French).
