### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Evon, a freelance, frontend-heavy web developer based in London. 

I currently design and build clean, responsive web apps using a variety of tech, but particularly enjoy React Redux / Typescript / Styled Components. I also mess around with a fully typesafe stack using Next, Prisma, and tRPC. More recently I've been working with Astro.

**Open to full-time or freelance opportunities**
