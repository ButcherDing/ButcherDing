### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Evon, a web developer based in London. Currently SEEKING FULL-TIME WORK (no sponsorship required).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently wrapping up an e-commerce React (Redux RTK) app for a Vancouver artist.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Redux/RTK, How to teach/learn, Ecological Economics ðŸ¤”
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: evon.scott@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: HIRE ME.

Too subtle?

#### How do I stand out from the pack? What makes me âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨:

- I made [this](https://ines-chuaqui-preview.netlify.app/) - repo [here](https://github.com/ButcherDing/ines-chuaqui). It has the stamp of approval of my mentor, a senior engineer who works with React every day. Ask me about it line by line. Not a copy-pasta.

- A background in sustainability and education. I care a lot about learning, sharing my knowledge with others, and the impact of the things I do.

- Social science. Being methodical about understanding people (incl. users, co-workers), their needs, the organisations/groups they belong to, and how it all fits together (the big picture). For example I conducted the research for and co-wrote [this paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0219607).

- Proven track record of delivering on complex projects in a real collaborative professional environment (as environmental social scientist).

- Excellent written and verbal communication, with all types of people and organizations, in multiple languages (Japanese, Spanish, French, and of course English).

- Adaptable, highly motivated, and a self-starter. I learned everything I know about coding/development in 6 months of self-teaching. Imagine how much more I can learn and do for your organization in 3, 6, 12 months or more?
