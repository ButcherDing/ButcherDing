### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Evon, a web developer based in London. 

I currently design and build slick, responsive web apps using React Redux / Javascript / Typescript / Styled Components.

**Seeking full-time work** (no sponsorship required).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently wrapping up an e-commerce React (Redux RTK) app for a Vancouver artist.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Redux/RTK, Teaching, Ecological Economics ðŸ¤”
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: evon.scott@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I volunteer teaching coding skills with [CodeYourFuture](https://codeyourfuture.io/) - it's fun!

Too subtle?

#### How do I stand out from other new devs? What makes me âœ¨ unique âœ¨:

- My portfolio, in particular [this app](https://ines-chuaqui-preview.netlify.app/) - ([repo here](https://github.com/ButcherDing/ines-chuaqui)). A complex e-commerce artist's website integrating google firebase/auth, react redux toolkit (RTK), and stripe.

- A background in sustainability and education. I care a lot about learning, sharing my knowledge with others, and the impact of my work.

- Social science. Being methodical about understanding people, their needs, the organisations they belong to, and how it all fits together. See my research here: [this paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0219607).

- Proven track record of delivering on complex projects, coordinating diverse teams (as environmental social scientist).

- Excellent written and verbal communication, pitching these to all types of organisations and audiences, sometimes in multiple languages (Japanese, Spanish, French... and English).

- Adaptable, highly motivated, disciplined, and a self-starter. I learned everything I know about coding/development in 9 months of self-teaching. Imagine what I can do for your organization in 3, 6, 12 months or more.
